# 🧭 Sonic Inclusion – Development Roadmap Overview  
*AI × Sound × Accessibility | Prototype Fund*

---

### 🔍 Project Summary  
**Sonic Inclusion** is an open-source toolkit exploring **AI-assisted sound design**, **accessibility**, and **multi-sensory interaction** (Audio ↔ Visual ↔ Gesture).  
Developed under **Prototype Fund Germany**, led by **Nicola Indjov / Indjoov Arts**.  
The roadmap below outlines all milestones, tasks, and estimated hours across six phases.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 1 – Research & Planning  
> Define vision, collect datasets, establish conceptual architecture.  

| # | Issue | Key Focus | Est. hrs |
|---|-------|------------|---------:|
| 1 | Define user needs + accessibility goals for AI-assisted sound design | Identify inclusion targets & use cases | 6 |
| 2 | Research Tone.js / Three.js integration examples + limitations | Evaluate framework interoperability | 4 |
| 3 | Design initial system diagram (AI ↔ Audio ↔ Visual Layers) | Draft architecture + signal flow | 6 |
| 4 | Collect open-source datasets + references for Sonic Inclusion | Build base corpus + technical references | 4 |

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2 – Setup & Architecture  
> Prepare repositories, base frameworks, and modular data flow.  

| # | Issue | Key Focus | Est. hrs |
|---|-------|------------|---------:|
| 5 | Prepare technical documentation template for collaborators | Create `/docs/` + README structure | 3 |
| 6 | Initialize repos + base frameworks (Tone.js, Three.js, AI) | Core setup + dependency management | 6 |
| 7 | Define modular controller + data flow architecture (AI↔Audio↔Visual) | Build controller module and event pipeline | 10 |

---

## 🧠 Phase 3 – Implementation & Testing  
> Develop core modules and evaluate performance.  

| # | Issue | Key Focus | Est. hrs |
|---|-------|------------|---------:|
| 8 | Build Tone.js ↔ Three.js modules for real-time mapping | Implement visual feedback engine | 10 |
| 9 | Implement AI intent mapping (gesture → sound) | ML inference + TensorFlow integration | 8 |
| 10 | Test and optimize latency / frame rate | GPU + browser performance tuning | 6 |

---

## 🎨 Phase 4 – Collaboration & Evaluation  
> Engage contributors and perform accessibility evaluation.  

| # | Issue | Key Focus | Est. hrs |
|---|-------|------------|---------:|
| 11 | Visual Feedback System (Tone.js + Three.js) Collaboration with @ParaMarcosEl | Co-dev AI + Visual module | 8 |
| 12 | Accessibility Testing + User Feedback Sessions | Collect qualitative & quantitative data | 6 |

---

## 📘 Phase 5 – Documentation & Release  
> Publish complete documentation, website, and demo v1.0.  

| # | Issue | Key Focus | Est. hrs |
|---|-------|------------|---------:|
| 13 | Documentation & Release v1 (Website, README, Demo links) | Finalize public release + website launch | 12 |

---

## 🌍 Phase 6 – Outreach & Future Planning  
> Prototype Fund final report + funding strategy for Phase 2.  

| # | Issue | Key Focus | Est. hrs |
|---|-------|------------|---------:|
| 14 | Outreach & Future Roadmap (Prototype Fund Final Report + Next Funding Phase) | Reporting + visibility + next funding applications | 14 |

---

## ⏱️ Total Estimated Time  
**~95–100 hours** (across 6 phases)
