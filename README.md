**Vision:**  
_Making sound visible, touchable, and inclusive for everyone._ 🌍🎶✨

## About the Project

**Sonic Inclusion** is an open-source toolkit that empowers musicians, artists, and developers to create **barrier-free sound experiences**.  
The project explores how **AI-driven tools** can support people with hearing impairments and diverse sensory needs by:

- 🎵 **Translating audio into adaptive visual & haptic feedback**
- 🧩 **Providing modular tools** for inclusive music software and installations
- 🤝 **Enabling collaboration** between sound artists, developers, and accessibility communities

This repository is developed as part of the **Prototype Fund (Germany)** and will grow into a publicly available resource for inclusive audio-visual design.

## Goals

- Build an **AI-powered accessibility toolkit** for sound and music
- Support **artists, educators, and communities** with practical tools
- Release everything as **open-source** (MIT License) to ensure free use and collaboration

## Roadmap

**Phase 1 – Prototyping (Months 1–3):**

- Develop first AI models for sound-to-visual mapping
- Build simple demo apps (desktop & web)

**Phase 2 – Testing (Months 4–5):**

- User testing with artists, educators & accessibility communities
- Improve accessibility features (screen readers, alternative input methods)

**Phase 3 – Release (Month 6):**

- Publish toolkit with documentation
- Share with open-source and cultural communities

**(Optional) Second Stage (Months 7–10):**

- Expand toolkit with plugins for DAWs and live performance setups
- Build community network around inclusive music-making

## Demo

This repository includes a tiny browser demo:

- Open `index.html` locally in your browser.
- Click **“Use Microphone”** or **“Load Audio File”** to see the visualisation.
- Adjust **Sensitivity** and **Color Mode** for different accessibility needs.

> Note: Runs locally without dependencies. Uses the Web Audio API.
